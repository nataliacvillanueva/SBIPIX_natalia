Simulation-based inference of galaxy properties from JWST pixels

---

The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies offer detailed insights into their stellar populations, capturing key physical properties such as stellar mass, star formation history (SFH), metallicity, and dust attenuation. However, inferring these properties from SEDs is a highly degenerate inverse problem, particularly when using integrated observations and a limited number of photometric bands. We present an efficient Bayesian SED-fitting framework tailored to multiwavelength pixel photometry from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). Our method employs simulation-based inference to enable rapid posterior sampling across galaxy pixels, leveraging the unprecedented spatial resolution, wavelength coverage, and depth provided by the survey. It is trained on synthetic photometry generated from MILES stellar population models, incorporating both parametric and non-parametric SFHs, realistic noise, and JADES-like filter sensitivity thresholds. We validate this amortised inference approach on mock datasets, achieving robust and well-calibrated posterior distributions, with an $R^2$ score of 0.99 for stellar mass. Applying our pipeline to real observations, we derive spatially resolved maps of stellar population properties down to $\mathrm{S/N}_{\rm{pixel}}=5$ (averaged over F277W, F356W, F444W) for $1083$ JADES galaxies and $\sim$2 million pixels with spectroscopic redshifts. These maps enable the identification of dusty or starburst regions and offer insights into mass growth and the structural assembly. We assess the outshining phenomenon by comparing pixel-based and integrated stellar mass estimates, finding limited impact only in low-mass galaxies ($<10^8\,M_{\odot}$) but systematic differences of $\sim$0.20 dex linked to SFH priors. With an average posterior sampling speed of $10^{-4}$ seconds per pixel and a total inference time of $\sim$1 CPU-day for the full dataset, our model offers a scalable solution for extracting high-fidelity stellar population properties from HST+JWST datasets, opening the way for statistical studies at sub-galactic scales.
